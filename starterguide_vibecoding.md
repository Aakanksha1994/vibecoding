## A No-Coder’s Guide to Starting Vibe Coding

Tp srart with Cursor

You don’t need to know how to code.
You don’t need to learn a language.
You don’t need to understand system design.

The only muscle you need is **problem-solving**.

That’s it.

---

### Step 1: Setup Cursor or Windsurf

Ask a friend or follow a video. Setup takes \~30–45 minutes.
Don’t try to understand everything. Just get it done and move on.

---

### Step 2: Start with a Simple Prompt

When you give a prompt to Cursor and it starts building, you’ll see a live process unfolding in the agentic window. It will say things like:

* "Now applying HTML..."
* "Creating CSS styles..."
* "Running this code..."

Start reading that process. You don’t need to understand or remember everything—just get into the habit of reading it. Over time, you’ll naturally get familiar with the steps, the commands, and how things work under the hood.

Open a file inside Cursor.
Type something like:

> "I want to create a webpage that asks for my name and shows a greeting."

Press ⌘+K and let Cursor handle it.

### Step 3: Keep Your First Goal Simple

Your aim: **host something locally on your machine**.
Not to learn JavaScript. Not to understand syntax. Not to make something complex.
Just build a basic thing and see it work.

---

### Step 4: Try These Projects

1. Gratitude journal (input box + list)
2. Mood tracker (Happy/Sad/Meh buttons)
3. Random quote generator (button shows a quote)
4. Todo list (add, mark done, delete)
5. Personal bio generator (you input, it generates)

Let’s actually build one.

**Project: Gratitude Tracker**

Open Cursor and type this prompt:

> "Create a gratitude tracker web app. It should take gratitude entries as input, save them, and show a list of all previous entries."

Give this prompt to Cursor (or ChatGPT). It will generate the app in one go.

Ask:

> "Where is it hosted?"
> "Where do I see my app?"

It’ll show you the localhost link—click and check. That’s your first mini-app.

This is your **aha** moment.

Now:

* Start editing the UI
* Add a button or two
* Change how it looks
* Add small features like delete or timestamps

You’ll start hitting small errors—and that’s where your **problem-solving muscle** kicks in.

Debug it using Step 5.

### Step 5: If You’re Stuck

You will get errors. Here’s what to do:

1. Copy the error from your terminal.
2. Paste it into the **agentic chat inside Cursor**.

   > "This is the error. What’s wrong? Fix it."

Let Cursor explain and fix.
Run again.

**Don’t worry about request usage in the beginning.**
Use Cursor freely till you're comfortable.

If Cursor doesn’t solve it:

* Paste the error into ChatGPT or Claude.
* Or ask in a group. Copy-paste the error.

Ask:

> "What is this error? How do I fix it?"

If you have access to engineers, ask them. It’ll take them 5–10 minutes. Ask them:

* Why it happened
* How to avoid it next time

---

### Step 6: That’s It

Use the product to solve the problem you picked.
Keep solving one bug at a time.
You’ll automatically pick up commands, patterns, and curiosity as you go.

No need for tutorials. No need for Gyan. Just build.

Welcome to Vibe Coding. Now clear 30 minutes in you schedule and go build one of the five projects above.
